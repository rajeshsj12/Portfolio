## Data Flow

### Static Content Flow
1. HTML provides semantic structure and content
2. CSS variables define design tokens and theming
3. JavaScript enhances interactivity and animations
4. External CDNs provide fonts and icons

### Animation Flow
1. Page load triggers initial animations
2. Scroll events activate intersection observers
3. Observers trigger CSS animations for elements entering viewport
4. User interactions trigger additional animations (hover, click)

### Navigation Flow
1. User clicks navigation link or scrolls
2. JavaScript calculates current section
3. Active navigation state updates
4. Smooth scroll behavior activates (if link clicked)

## External Dependencies

### Content Delivery Networks
- **Google Fonts**: Inter and JetBrains Mono font families
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library (version 6.4.0)

### Browser APIs Used
- **Intersection Observer API**: For scroll-triggered animations
- **requestAnimationFrame**: For smooth animations
- **CSS Custom Properties**: For dynamic theming
- **Scroll Behavior API**: For smooth scrolling

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting
The website is designed for static hosting environments:
- No server-side processing required
- All assets are client-side
- Can be deployed to any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)

### File Structure
```
/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── css/
│   ├── style.css       # Main stylesheet with design system
│   └── animations.css  # Animation definitions
└── js/
    └── main.js         # Main JavaScript functionality
```

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal external dependencies
- CSS and JavaScript are concatenated for production
- Images should be optimized for web
- Lazy loading implemented for below-the-fold content
- Critical CSS inlined for faster initial render

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Fallbacks for CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Polyfills for Intersection Observer if needed

### SEO Optimization
- Semantic HTML structure
- Meta tags for description and social sharing
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Alt text for images
- Clean URL structure with anchor links
